This application will enable users to view the top headlines, stories and videos from 
ESPN.  I will build this application using Twitter Bootstrap 3, AngularJS.  This will be a responsive application allowing users to view sports information via a computer browser as well as from their mobile phones.

Unfortunately my database crashed so I am in the process of revamping my application of Sports Fix.

I have decided to use BackboneJS, UnderScoreJS, Handlebars, and JQuery to mock up my application.

I am using BackboneJS to handle the Model, View, Controller (MVC) portion of the application, while 
UnderScoreJS and HandlebarsJS are taking care of the templating of my different views.  UnderScoreJS
is a dependency of Backbone originally and also created by the same person that created BackboneJS.
JQuery is also a dependency of BackboneJS but I will also use the JQuery library to do some animation
of the views.

I already have the beginning of the application done, where I have implemented the libraries in which I will 
commit those files up to GitHub as well.
